    This module provides an introduction to the imperative, object-oriented and concurrent programming using a high level language, e.g. Java. In addition to the knowledge of general programming principles, concepts, methods and techniques for displaying, structuring and processing of data and the development of algorithms are discussed. Particular emphasis is set on conceptual clarity and precise mathematical foundation with formal methods.
    The main topics of the course are as follows:
    Â· basic concepts about programs and their implementation;
    Â· syntax of programming languages and their description;
    Â· basic data types and imperative control structures;
    Â· complexity and correctness of imperative programs;
    Â· recursion;
    Â· simple sorting methods;
    Â· introduction to the object-oriented program design;
    Â· classes, interfaces and packages;
    Â· inheritance, and exception handling;
    Â· object-oriented implementation of lists and tree structures;
    Â· basic concepts of concurrent programming: threads, synchronization and deadlock,
    Â· Introduction to UML-Diagrams,
    Â· Programming with an Integrated Development Environment (currently Eclipse).
    There is a multitude of introductory books about Computer Science and Java in particular. A comprehensive Java book, which is also online available, is:
    Â· Java ist auch eine Insel, von Christian Ullenboom, Gilileo Computing, ISBN = 978-3-83621802-3
    An easier introductory book is
    Â· Java kompakt, von HÃ¶zl, Read und Wirsing, Springer Vieweg, ISBN 978-3-642-28503-5
    The module consists of a lecture and in addition exercises in small groups. The concepts introduced in the lecture are practiced in the exercise class with concrete examples.

    The students will be able to implement solutions for small and manageable problems algorithmically and to realize them with a high level programming language as executable programs. Using an IDE like Eclipse facilitates the professionalisation. Furthermore, students develop an understanding of the general principles of programming and programming languages. This lays the foundation to ensure that the students (after further experiences in the course of study) may become familiar quickly and accurately with any programming language.

    The module gives a hands-on introduction into analysis and its applications. The main focus is on the development of mathematical methods and insights. It introduces sets, relations, mappings, induction, recursive definitions, real numbers, sequences and series, power series, continuous and differentiable functions in one and many variables, complex numbers, norms, and metrics.
    The module consists of a lecture and in addition exercises in small groups. The concepts introduced in the lecture are practiced in the exercise class with concrete examples.
    The basic parts of Analysis are to be understood. Mathematical methods and ways of thinking are to be adopted.

    The module gives a hands-on introduction to the methods of linear algebra, their applications, and the development of basic algebraic notions. It introduces vectors, real matrices and linear algebra in the R n , abstract linear algebra, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
    The module consists of a lecture and in addition exercises in small groups. The concepts introduced in the lecture are practiced in the exercise class with concrete examples.
    The basics of Linear Algebra as well as general mathematical ways of thinking are to be understood and practically applicable.

    This module introduces to descriptive statistics. It starts by discussing methods to describe and characterize univariate frequency distributions. Then the basic descriptive techniques for multivariate data are developed and different methods to measure association and correlation
    are introduced and an introduction to linear regression modelling is given. Basics on stitistical graphics are presented. Furthermore, basics of the practical data analysis are presented. Basic concepts of using selected statistical software packages are presented. First small practical data anaylsis projects are conducted.
    The lecture develops central concepts and methods of descriptive Statistics. Important properties of the main techniques are formulated and illustrated via selected examples. The students shall become proficient with the fundamental methods of descriptive Statistics.
    The exercise classes will deepen the contents of the lecture by applying it to exercises and small projects. The exercise classes shall deepen the understanding of the concepts taught in the lecture and shall enable the students to apply and implement the methods and techniques taught in the lecture.

In addition to the knowledge of general programming principles, concepts, methods and techniques for displaying, structuring and processing of data and the development of algorithms are discussed. Particular emphasis is set on conceptual clarity and precise mathematical foundation with formal methods. The main topics of the course are as follows: basic concepts about programs and their implementation; syntax of programming languages and their description; basic data types and imperative control structures; complexity and correctness of imperative programs; recursion; simple sorting methods; introduction to the object-oriented program design; classes, interfaces and packages; inheritance, and exception handling; object-oriented implementation of lists and tree structures; basic concepts of concurrent programming: threads, synchronization and deadlock; Introduction to UML-Diagrams; Programming with an Integrated Development Environment (currently Eclipse).",
            "learning_outcomes": "The students will be able to implement solutions for small and manageable problems algorithmically and to realize them with a high level programming language as executable programs. Using an IDE like Eclipse facilitates the professionalisation. Furthermore, students develop an understanding of the general principles of programming and programming languages. This lays the foundation to ensure that the students (after further experiences in the course of study) may become familiar quickly and accurately with any programming language."
