## 2 Introduction

The text describes the current curriculum of the Bachelor's degree program 'Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence'.

In particular, it points out the study objectives and module contents of all compulsory modules, the subject-scientific elective modules and the internship-accompanying courses of the program as well as the semester hours per module and study semester.

In case of ambiguity, the superordinate study and examination regulations take precedence.

## 2.1 Background

For years, it has been pointed out again and again that Germany, just like the rest of the world, is lacking more computer scientists than ever before: the gap is growing every year. The digital transformation of the working world as well as of private life through technologies such as the Internet of Everything, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data Analytics based on increasingly powerful hardware and connectivity solutions is the driver for this demand. In contrast, the number of Computer Science graduates is growing comparatively slowly.

In addition to the German-language programs offered by the THI in various Computer Science disciplines, the English-language program 'Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence' is intended to inspire students to pursue a career as Computer Science and AI specialist. By using English as the language of instruction, the catchment area for applicants can be extended worldwide. On the one hand, this gives the region's labor market access to well-educated graduates who would otherwise have been difficult to attract, and on the other hand, it supports the THI's internationalization strategy, which, in addition to increasing the international visibility of the THI, also aims to promote exchange and cooperation in teaching and research through international working groups ( → internationalization@home).

## 2.2 Study Objectives

The objective of the Bachelor's degree program 'Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence' is to provide students a technical expertise in the field of Computer Science, with a special focus on AI. This is achieved by an application-oriented teaching based on scientific results and methods. Graduates are suitably qualified for responsible professional positions in globally active enterprises and organizations in this field. In addition to the transfer of knowledge, understanding and practical skills, the development of personal skills is another important goal.

Graduates know the most important concepts, methods and techniques of Computer Science and can think in abstract models, assess the possibilities and limitations of algorithmic procedures and develop adequate computing solutions for complex application problems. They have a fundamental understanding of the most important AI technologies and can introduce, integrate, customize or develop AI systems in companies to provide digital solutions that mimic the aspects of human cognition or decision-making and adapt to changing conditions. The graduates are aware of their responsibility for the social and societal impact of their work and respect the diversity of people. To keep up with the rapidly progressing development of computer science, they consider themselves as lifelong learners and researchers.

The Bachelor's degree offers the basis for further scientific qualification in a consecutive Master's degree program.

## 2.3 Target Group

The Bachelor's degree program 'Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence' is aimed at applicants who:

- · are interested in information processing and are aiming for a job or a research career in the field of Computer Science, in particular with a focus on Artificial Intelligence,
- · have a thorough understanding of basic Mathematics, a good ability to abstract and the ability to think logically,
- · (as an international applicant) would like to pursue a later career in Germany or would like to support German companies or organizations abroad, or (as a German applicant) intend to lay the foundation for an international career,
- · want to help shape the digital future in a globalized world.

## 2.4 Admission Requirements

For admission to the Bachelor's degree program 'Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence', the general university entrance requirements for studying at Bavarian Universities of Applied Sciences must be met. As a rule, these are either the general or the subject-restricted university entrance qualification. The detailed regulations can be found in the Ordinance on Qualification for Studies at Universities of the Free State of Bavaria (QualV).

International applicants whose certificates are not issued in German language and according to the German grading scheme must submit their school and university certificates to uniassist in order to determine their eligibility for studying at THI. Uni-assist will prepare a preliminary review documentation (VPD) which must be submitted together with an application to THI. The uni-assist website also provides access to a database that allows an initial assessment of whether the university entrance qualification obtained abroad qualifies the international student for studying in Germany.

Since winter semester 2022/23, the Bachelor's degree program 'Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence' has been subject to admission restrictions. The THI determines the admission figures annually by statute.

## 2.5 Structure and Duration of the Study Program

The regular period of study of the Bachelor's degree program 'Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence' comprises seven semesters. The study program is divided into two study sections.

<!-- image -->

The first study section consists of two in-classroom semesters. The second study section includes four in-classroom semesters and a full internship semester, which is usually the 5th semester.

It is possible to continue the Bachelor's degree program 'Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence' directly with a suitable Master's degree program, provided that its admission requirements are met.

## 2.6 Practical Study Semester (Internship Semester)

The practical study semester within the second study section covers a period of 20 weeks and is accompanied by courses. All students must pass the practical semester during their studies. The main part of the practical semester is an internship that is completed in a company in industry, small and medium-sized businesses or public administration.

Students choose their internship employer independently. If no student of the THI has ever done an internship with this internship employer before, the approval of the internship commissioner must be obtained in advance.

The internship is accompanied by two courses at the THI, one of which takes place before (Preinternship Seminar) and the other after the internship (Post-internship Seminar).

## 2.7 Advancement Requirements

To ensure that the skills required for understanding the next stages of study are available, there are some advancement requirements. Failure to meet these requirements will result in a delay in study progress that should be used to re-work on the respective gaps. In order to keep the overall duration of studies within reasonable limits, there are also some deadlines to be observed.

The following list provides an overview of these requirements and deadlines 1 :

- 1. Only students who have earned at least 42 ECTS credit points from the modules of the first two semesters can enter the third semester.
- 2. Only students who have passed all examinations and performance certificates of the first study section, and who have acquired at least 20 ECTS credit points from the compulsory modules of the second study section can enter the practical semester.
- 3. Prerequisite for issuing a topic for the Bachelor's thesis is the successful completion of the internship semester.

The wording of the binding regulations can be found in the Study and Examination Regulations (SPO) of the program 'Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence', in the Bavarian Examination Regulations Framework (RaPO), in the General Examination Regulations of the THI (APO) and in the Matriculation statutes of the THI under the following link:

## 2.8 Academic Degree

After successfully passing all exams, THI awards graduates of the program 'Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence' the academic degree:

Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.)

## 3.2.3 Elective Modules

In the 7 th semester, two subject-specific elective modules must be taken. Elective modules should allow students to select subject specializations according to their individual interests. A catalog of suitable elective modules is compiled each semester. Elective modules often deal with very specific topics and are offered by external lecturers from professional practice, whose availability may be limited.

Online registration in elective modules occurs at the end of each preceding semester. This registration is necessary to determine the number of participants. Elective modules can only be organized if a sufficient number of participants is reached.

## 4 Qualification Profile

Artificial Intelligence is a technological megatrend in all high-tech countries of this world. It is undisputed that Artificial intelligence is already changing the economy and people's everyday lives worldwide and will continue to do so in the coming years. This is underscored not least by the development of political strategies and goals in most high-tech countries, including the German government's national AI strategy and the high-tech agenda of the state of Bavaria. Accordingly, the demand for AI specialists is high, with the trend continuing to rise.

Artificial intelligence is a branch of Computer Science that deals with the automation or simulation of cognitive abilities. Accordingly, it is essential that graduates know the most important concepts, methods and techniques in Computer Science and are able to apply them adequately. In addition, they must have a basic understanding of the most important AI technologies in order to be able to plan, install or integrate, customize, develop or implement AI systems.

In order to demonstrate that graduates of the 'Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence' program at THI receive a high-quality  Computer Science education that meets European standards, the learning objectives of this program are compared to the learning outcomes expected as an educational basis for practicing a profession or for post-graduate studies according to the Euro-Inf Framework Standards and Accreditation Criteria for Informatics Programmes.

## 4.2 THI Mission Statement

The learning outcomes of the 'Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence' program comply with the Principles of teaching as they are formulated in THI's mission statement 'Personalities for a future worth living' as follows:

## · Our graduates are cosmopolitan and innovative personalities.

The international composition of the study groups, with nationalities from all continents, promotes the idea of cosmopolitanism, namely that all people are part of a single world community. Their interest and commitment to modern computer science and artificial intelligence shows that students are open to innovation.

- · Our teaching staff supports students in their professional and personal development.

The seminar-based face-to-face teaching format and the accompaniment of most modules by separate exercise or practical courses enable the greatest possible degree of interaction between students and lecturers. Seminars and projects in which students work self-directed but are supervised by instructors develop students toward self-dependence.

- · We foster a spirit of innovation and teach entrepreneurial thinking.

From the evolution of hardware and software technology and AI to the concepts commonly used today, the students recognize the innovation steps of the past and which considerations led to them. By addressing the open research questions of today, they are encouraged to think innovatively themselves. Through the module 'Entrepreneurship' and the option to acquire a corresponding certificate during their studies at THI's Center of Entrepreneurship, they are introduced to the idea of founding their own start-up company.

- · In practical courses, laboratory work and projects, our students acquire applicable problem-solving skills.
- If only the compulsory modules of the program are considered (without the internship semester and the Bachelor's thesis), the share of instructed exercise courses, labs and projects already amounts to about 42% of all semester hours. The task assignments are often based on current topics from research projects that the instructors are conducting in parallel at the THI.
- · Our students gain international experience during their studies and acquire foreign language and intercultural skills.

Due to the international diversity of the students, an intercultural exchange occurs automatically during their studies. International students learn the German language in their everyday life (level A1 is compulsory upon entering the program), the language of instruction is English. THI's International Office supports interested students in studying abroad for a semester or doing the internship semester at a foreign company.

- · Small groups and seminar-based teaching formats allow for individual exchange with our students.

The aim is to have group sizes of 50-60 students per year. Exercises and practical courses are usually offered in two parallel classes with group sizes of 25-30 students, seminars and projects are laid out for group sizes of 15 students.

All teaching staff offer regular office hours every week that students can use to discuss subject-related and non-subject-related questions individually.

As part of the continuous improvement of teaching quality, a round table is held once a year with all students of a cohort, where students can give direct feedback on their studies to the program director.

- · We support the diversity of our students and help them develop their talents and self-competences.

By learning and working together, students experience to benefit from different strengths and ideas in the group and to respect each other. At the same time, they develop communication skills in dealing with each other, such as arguing comprehensibly and transforming an initial disagreement into a consensus. Approximately 50% of the semester hours are spent in courses that have active student participation as a central element, such as projects, seminars, exercises and practical courses.

Interested students can also get involved as tutors or in supporting THI's various research projects, thus getting to know teaching from the other side or research from the inside.

## 4.3 Concept of Exams and Tests

According to the 2010 version of the common structural guidelines for the accreditation of study programs, 'in order to reduce the examination load, modules are generally completed with only one exam, the result of which is included in the final certificate'.

This means that for modules that also include practical components, the successful completion of tests on these components is considered an 'admission requirement' for the single module exam.

Depending on the objective and type of the individual modules, different forms of examination are used for the module exams.

## · Written examination (schrP)

A written exam is particularly suitable for examining professional and methodical competence. It takes place within the examination period at the end of a semester. The processing period of usually 90 minutes is sufficient examine the entire scope of learning at random.

- · Seminar paper (SA)

This is a term paper with oral presentation. The submission of the term paper and the oral presentation can take place during the semester.

The learning objectives focus on presentation and communication competences and include the self-dependent compilation of a scientific topic, the structuring of the content, the comprehensible presentation and argumentation, the selection and handling of suitable media and the appropriate arrangement of the written elaboration. Thus, self-competencies must be demonstrated such as self-motivation and planning, time management, organization, and cognitive load management.

## · Project work (ProjA)

A project work is a group work in which several students work on a common task in a team. Each student has to contribute individually to the common task. The group presents its results orally at the end of the semester and submits a joint project report.

In addition to technical and methodical competence, social competences must be demonstrated, such as teamwork skills, critical thinking and self-reflection.

## · Proof of performance (LN)

This is a generic term for a number of exam and test forms.

In the case of practical courses, this type of examination usually involves practical laboratory work or programming tasks. In the case of main modules, it can alternatively be a written exam, an oral exam, a term paper or a presentation. Details are described in the appendix to the study and examination regulations and in the study plan.

- · Internship report (PrB)

This report serves to reflect personal experiences and knowledge gained during the internship. Furthermore, these experiences and knowledge should be related to knowledge from the ongoing studies. In addition, the internship report should demonstrate the ability to formulate a coherent, subject-related text in a precise, objective and linguistically correct manner.

- · Bachelor's thesis (BA)

With the Bachelor's thesis, the student provides evidence at the end of his or her studies that he or she is capable of self-dependently writing a scientific paper under the supervision of an instructor.

## 4.4 Possible Career Fields

Graduates of the program are primarily prepared for specialist and managerial tasks in the following areas:

- · Software development, AI and Data Science applications development, Cloud-based application development, Web application development, Mobile App development
- · IT/Software and AI consulting, training
- · Project management of IT/Software and AI projects.

Graduates are hired in application areas wherever information is stored, processed and transmitted - nowadays this is across all industries, enterprises and organizations. The industry with the most job searches for Computer Science and AI is currently Technology, followed closely by Consulting, Life Sciences, Retail and Media.

## Examinations:

6.1: schrP90 - written exam, 90 minutes (CAI\_Prog2) 6.2: LN - participation without/with success (CAI\_Prog2Pr)

## Requirements:

A prerequisite for participation in the written examination is a successfully completed practical course (see SPO-No. 6.2).

Within the practical course, five tasks, which deal with essential topics of the lecture will be given. To pass the practical course, all five tasks must be completed successfully with respect to task deadlines.

## Prerequisites according examination regulation:

None

## Recommended prerequisites:

Python programming to the extent of Programming 1

## Objectives:

Lecture: After successful participation students are able to:

- · explain the basics of object-oriented programming.
- · use basic abstract data structures for algorithmic problem solving.
- · create an algorithmic solution for moderately difficult problems.
- · formulate given and self-designed data structures and algorithms in Java.

Practical Course: Upon completion of the course students have practical knowledge in the application of essential Java programming concepts such as inheritance, interface, etc. They also gain initial experience with the JUNIT test framework and user interface programming with JavaFX.

## Content:

- · Basics of object-oriented programming; key terms: class, object, method, message, interface, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
- · Programming knowledge in Java (general OOP and in the Java language: sequence control, data types, class libraries, programme structure via class hierarchy, parameter transfer mechanisms, lifetime and usability of objects, work of the garbage collector)
- · Object-oriented modelling (data encapsulation and access protection in classes, structuring inheritance hierarchies, use of class libraries: collections, streams, threads)
- · Dynamic data structures: linked lists, hash tables, trees, streams
- · Advanced language concepts: interface definition via interfaces, exception handling, parameterised classes (generics), lambda expressions
- · Graphical user interfaces with JavaFX, handling asynchronous events
- · Parallel programming with threads

Practical course:

As part of the practical course, a media player is developed in the Java programming language. The player is operated via a JavaFX-based user interface. The acceptance tests are carried out automatically using predefined JUNIT test classes. The classes to be created must provide certain interface functionalities in order to successfully pass the tests.

## Prerequisites according examination regulation:

None

## Recommended prerequisites:

Successful participation in module "Introduction to Computer Science 1"

## Objectives:

This course continues a course from the previous semester, which created a basic understanding of how computable algorithms are executed on computers.

The objective of this course is to convey how the operating system, as an additional software layer, manages all those components of a computer that were introduced in the previous course in such a way that they can be shared by one or more application programs that run simultaneously. A second objective is to convey how autonomous computers can communicate and interact with each other over fixed or mobile networks.

After successful participation, the students are able:

- · to explain the tasks and functions of operating systems.
- · to understand and use basic operating system concepts, assess corresponding implementations and possible problems.

- · classify existing operating systems and assess future developments.

They are also able:

- · to describe and classify the basic concepts of computer networks.
- · to explain the tasks of communication layers in a reference model and to identify them in local area networks and in the Internet.
- · to understand the most important communication protocols of the Internet and to describe their characteristics and limits.

## Examinations:

- 11.1: schrP90 - written exam, 90 minutes (CAI\_SwEng)
- 11.2: LN - participation without/with success (CAI\_SwEngPr)

## Requirements:

A prerequisite for participation in the written examination is a successfully completed practical course (see SPO-No. 11.2).

To successfully pass the course, continuous participation and individual (re)processing of tasks on the computer are mandatory - especially if no or only little previous experience in the field of software development is available. In the context of the practical course, various tasks that deal with different topics of the lecture are to be worked on independently. For this purpose, the students have to work on up to 10 task sheets. The solutions are to be handed in individually or in small groups within a given time schedule (usually every

- 1 - 2 weeks), whereby questions about the solution concept created are to be answered. The schedule is aligned with the progress of the lecture. Only if 80% of the tests are acquired in time, the performance record (predicate "passed with success") is considered to be achieved.

## Prerequisites according examination regulation:

This module can only be taken if the second study section has been achieved. For this purpose, at least 42 credit points (ECTS) from the first study section must be recorded.

## Recommended prerequisites:

Basics of programming

Basics of Computer Science

## Objectives:

After attending the course, the students:

- · have the basic competences for the development of small and medium-sized software systems.
- · are familiar with the basic steps of software engineering.
- · know existing quality models and their meaning for the development of software.
- · can describe requirements to a software system in a structured way.
- · know fundamental architecture principles and can uses these for creating software architectures.
- · can use selected diagrams of the UML for the description and documentation of a software system.
- · know the basic process of testing.
- · can use different testing strategies.
- · are familiar with basic procedure models for software development.

## After attending the practical course:

- · the students have their own practical experience in applying software engineering methods.
- · the students have practical experiences in the analysis, planning and conversion of software systems.

## Objectives:

In this module, students learn to use more advanced algorithms of artificial intelligence and their applications on structures, unstructured and temporal data. The basic idea and mathematical backgrounds of neural networks are introduced. Students learn how to train simple neural networks to learn patterns from data for regression and classification tasks. Further, Deep Learning and its most common architectures are introduced, including Convolutions and recurrent connections. Students learn how to effectively train deep learning networks by choosing optimal hyperparameters and how to avoid overfitting. Thus, methods like Regularization and Dropout are explained. The goal of this module is further to introduce unsupervised learning

to the students, as well as its application to solve clustering problems. The application of unsupervised learning in combination with neural networks is illustrated by introducing autoencoders. In addition, it is shown how to use unsupervised learning methods to reduce the dimensionality of datasets using feature selection and PCA techniques. After successfully attending this module, students know:

- · How to handle structured, unstructured and temporal data.
- · What a neural network is and how it can be trained using backpropagation.
- · How to use different optimizers for neural networks.

## Examinations:

18.1: schrP90 - written exam, 90 minutes (CAI\_CVis) 18.2: LN - participation without/with success (CAI\_CVisPr)

## Requirements:

A prerequisite for participation in the written examination is a successfully completed practical course (see SPO-No. 18.2).

In the practical course, the contents of the lecture are deepened by means of practical tasks. In order to obtain the admission requirement for participation in the final and graded written examination, a semesterlong practical course must be passed "with success". Successful completion of the accompanying practical course is a prerequisite for participation in the examination. To receive the certificate of achievement, a project must be worked on and submitted. The project results must be summarized in a written report and presented in a short presentation. The task set in the project as well as the presentation will be evaluated by the lecturer. On the basis of this evaluation, admission for participation in the final and graded written examination will be decided.

## Prerequisites according examination regulation:

This module can only be taken if the second study section has been achieved. For this purpose, at least 42 credit points (ECTS) from the first study section must be recorded.

## Recommended prerequisites:

19.1: schrP90 - written exam, 90 minutes (CAI\_AAI3) 19.2: LN - participation without/with success (CAI\_AAI3Pr)

## Requirements:

A prerequisite for participation in the written examination is a successfully completed practical course (see SPO-Nor. 19.2).

## Prerequisites according examination regulation:

This module can only be taken if the second study section has been achieved. For this purpose, at least 42 credit points (ECTS) from the first study section must be recorded.

## Recommended prerequisites:

None

## Objectives:

This module completes the trilogy of AI algorithms. After the basics and techniques of statistical/stochastic AI have been introduced and learned in the first two modules, this module supplements the holistic overview with selected, practice-relevant application areas of machine learning methods, with approaches of distributed AI and with the most important concepts and methods of symbolic AI.

After successfully completing this module, the students:

- · can reflect the purpose and background of selected machine learning applications that are frequently used in practice.
- · understand that distributed AI allows not to join the necessary huge amounts of data at a central site, but to analyze the data directly at the source.

- · are proficient in some concepts and techniques of symbolic AI, where the solution strategy is not learned from sample data but is based on knowledge that is represented symbolically. Such methods are used when no data is available for the learning process or when the task can be represented in terms of logical relationships.
- · are able to formally represent knowledge using appropriate models and languages.
- · have practical experience in applying formal knowledge models within knowledge-based systems. This objective involves the use of formal knowledge representation techniques to design and implement systems capable of intelligent behaviour, such as expert systems and automated reasoning systems.

The practical course accompanying the course "Algorithms for AI 3" serves to teach and train the students to put into practice the knowledge they have acquired in the lecture. In addition, to preparatory exercises, the students must independently solve four programming tasks of increasing complexity during the semester and write executable programs. The finished programs are presented to the respective  lecturer  and  thus  also  serve  as  proof  of  performance  for  admission  to  the  examination.

## Content:

- · Selected, practice-relevant application areas of machine learning methods
- o Recommender Systems
- o Fraud Detection (banking, financial services)
- o Biometric Recognition

## Examinations:

22.1: schrP90 - written exam, 90 minutes (CAI\_HCI) 22.2: LN - participation without/with success (CAI\_HCIPr)

## Requirements:

A prerequisite for participation in the written examination is a successfully completed practical course (see SPO-No. 22.2).

Within the framework of the practical course, 6 practical tasks (on core topics of the lecture) must be solved in groups of 2 or 3. The practical course is held in blocks in the middle of the semester. For each practical task, papers/protocols are to be prepared and handed in - in particular, importance is attached to a selfinterpretation of the results. Only if all tasks are handed in on time (processing time per task usually 2 weeks, deadlines see Moodle), the performance record (entrance requirement for lecture exam) is considered to be fulfilled.

## Prerequisites according examination regulation:

This module can only be taken if the second study section has been achieved. For this purpose, at least 42 credit points (ECTS) from the first study section must be recorded.

## Recommended prerequisites:

None

## Examinations:

BA - Bachelor-Thesis (CAI\_Thesis)

Requirements:

None

## Prerequisites according examination regulation:

The topic of the Bachelor's thesis can be issued at the beginning of the sixth semester at the earliest. The prerequisite is the successful completion of the internship semester.

## Recommended prerequisites:

None

## Objectives:

The students are able to work independently on a task from the field of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence using scientific methods and according to scientific quality standards within a given period of time. This includes the research and presentation of the state of the art, the development of the necessary theoretical foundations, the problem-oriented and independent development of proposals for solution, as well as the presentation and interpretation of the results.

## Content:

Preparation of a Bachelor's thesis, including

- · Development and concretization of a relevant problem statement
- · Preparation of a work plan and time schedule
- · Literature research
- · Presentation of relevant basics
- · Discussion of appropriate methods for a solution

- · Justified selection and application of a problem-solving approach
- · Test, evaluation of results and drawing of conclusions against the background of the existing constraints
- · Written formulation and, if necessary, suitable visualizations (diagrams, tables, etc.)
- · Final review of the thesis for logical coherence and linguistic correctness and comprehensibility

In general, the student seeks a topic for the thesis autonomously. Topics are either offered within the university by professors or scientific staff members via notice boards (also online) or arise from the cooperation of the student with an external company. In case of an external topic, it is advisable to outline the topic and the envisaged approach in a short exposé. This groundwork makes it easier to approach a professor at the university and get him to be the first examiner.

## Literature:

No general literature is required.
