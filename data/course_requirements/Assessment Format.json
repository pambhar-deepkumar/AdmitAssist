        "Learning Outcome": "After attending this module, students are able to understand computer systems as layered abstract machines. They get a first impression of the area of computer architectures and possess the following abilities: They have learned to apply the main concepts of machine-oriented programming, microprogramming and circuit design. They understand the machine instruction cycles based on the underlying hardware at the register transfer level and they are able to classify computer architectures. The understand the basics of modern computer architecture."
