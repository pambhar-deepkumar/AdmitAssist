## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

The lecture provides basic knowledge of fundamental concepts of data management and data analysis in Big Data Engineering.

Aspartoftheexercises, a project can be carried out during the semester. This can be, for example, a social network (Facebook style) or any other project where data management techniques can be practiced (e.g., natural science data, image data, other webapplications, etc.). First, this project will be modeled in E/R, then realized and implemented in a database schema. Then the project is extended to manage and analyze unstructured data as well. Altogether, all fundamental techniques that are important for managing and analyzing data are thus demonstrated on a single project.

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

The participants of this course get acquainted with concurrency in computation as a far-reaching and foundational principle with respect to both theory and application of modern computing sciences. By analysing and applying different formal models, the participants gain a deeper understanding of concurrency, and learn to apply formal computing concepts correctly. The theoretical knowledge acquired in the first half of the lecture is in the second half applied to practical programming. Therein, participants learn using the programming paradigms 'shared memory' and 'message passing' starting off with the programming language pseuCo before applying their skills to Java and (partially) to Go. In addition, participants learn to describe various phenomena of concurrent programming using formal models, and to derive concrete solutions for practical

problems from them. Moreover, the participants examine existing practitioneer's concepts with respect to their reliability. A specific aspect of this professional practice is the tactically adequate reaction to concurrency problems under tight time constraints.

## Inhalt

- · distributed systems (client-server, peer-to-peer, databases, the Internet)

## Problems of Concurrency

- · resource conflicts
- · fairness
- · mutual exclusion
- · deadlock
- · livelock
- · starvation

## Foundations of Concurrency

- · sequential vs. concurrent processes
- · states, events and transitions
- · transition systems
- · observable behaviour
- · determinism vs. non-determinism
- · algebras and operators

## CCS - The Calculus of Communicating Systems

- · constructing processes: sequence, choice, recursion
- · concurrency and interaction
- · structural operational semantics
- · equivalence of observations
- · implementation relations
- · CCS with message passing

## Programming Concurrency

- · pseuCo
- · message passing in pseuCo and Go
- · shared memory in pseuCo and Java
- · shared objects and threads in Java
- · shared objects and threads as transition systems

## Programming and Analysis Support

- · deadlock detection
- · verification of safety and liveness
- · model-based design supporting concurrency
- · software architectures supporting concurrency

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

In this course we will discuss the foundations - the elements - of machine learning. In particular, we will focus on the ability of, given a data set, to choose an appropriate method for analyzing it, to select the appropriate parameters for the model generated by that method and to assess the quality of the resulting model. Both theoretical and practical aspects will be covered. What we cover will be relevant for computer scientists in general as well as for other scientists involved in data analysis and modeling.

## Inhalt

The lecture covers basic machine learning methods, in particular the following contents:

- · Introduction to statistical learning
- · Overview over Supervised Learning
- · Linear Regression
- · Linear Classification
- · Splines
- · Model selection and estimation of the test errors
- · Maximum-Likelihood Methods
- · Additive Models
- · Decision trees

- · Boosting
- · Dimensionality reduction
- · Unsupervised learning
- · Clustering
- · Visualization

## Literaturhinweise

The course broadly follows the book An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R , Springer (2013). In some cases, the course receives additional material from the book The Elements of Statistical Learning , Springer (second edition, 2009). The first book is the introductory text, the second covers more advanced topics. Both books are available as free PDFs. Any change of, or additional material will be announced before the start of the course on the course webpage.

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

Students get to know the most important methods of designing algorithms and data structures: divide-and-conquer,dynamicprogramming,incrementalconstruction,'greedyalgorithms',decimation,forminghierarchies, randomization. They learn to analyze algorithms and data structures for their time and space requirements with respect to the usual RAM machine model and to compare them on this basis. Various kinds of analysis are considered (worst case, amortized, expected case).

Students get acquainted with important efficient data structures and algorithms. They should acquire the ability to apply theoretial analyses and considerations to given methods in order to check their applicability to actually occuring scenarios. Moreover, students should school their skills in developing or adjusting algorithms and data structures with performance guarantees in mind.

Examination performances are given in two parts, which contribute equally to the final grade. To pass the entire course, each part must be passed individually.

In the practical part , students must implement a series of programming tasks in- dependently. These programming tasks allow students to practise language con- ceptsandalsointroducemorecomplexalgorithmsanddatastructures. Automatic tests check the quality of the implementations. The grade of the practical part is largely determined by the test results.

In the lecture part , students must complete written examinations and work on ex- ercises. The exercises deepen the material of the lecture. Admission to the written examination depends on the successful completion of the exercises.

In the practical part, a follow-up task can be offered.

Leistungskontrollen / Prüfungen

The goal of the Software Engineering Lab is to develop a non-trivial software sys- tem, partly in team effort and partly in individual effort. In this course, a number of documents (design models, documentation, etc.) and artifacts (source code, tests, etc.) need to be developed and submitted. Correctness, quality, and timely submission of all documents and artifacts are major grading criteria.

The Software Engineering Lab consists of three phases: exercise, group, and indi- vidual phase. In the exercise phase , participants will complete mini-tests on a daily basis, covering current topics from the lecture.

In the group phase , participants will design, implement, and test a substantial software system in a team effort. Only participants that have passed the exercise phase will be admitted to the group phase.

In the individual phase , participants will design, develop, and test a smaller system (or extension to a larger system) in an individual effort. Only participants that have passed the group phase will be admitted to the individual phase.

All documents (design models, documentation, etc.) and artifacts (source code, tests, etc.) of the three phases will be evaluated based on the principles and quality standard conveyed in the lectures. More details on the exams will be announced at the beginning of the course.

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

This course provides the theoretical and practical foundation for computer graphics. It gives a wide overview of topics, techniques, and approaches used in various aspects of computer graphics but has some focus on image synthesis or rendering. The first part of the course uses ray tracing as a driving applications to discuss core topics of computer graphics, from vector algebra all the way to sampling theory, the human visual system, sampling theory, and spline curves and surfaces. A second part then uses rasterization approach as a driving example, introducing the camera transformation, clipping, the OpenGL API and shading langue, plus advanced techniques.

As part of the practical exercises the students incrementally build their own ray tracing system. Once the basics have been covered, the students participate in a rendering competition. Here they can implement their favorite advanced algorithm and are asked to generate a high-quality rendered image that shows their techniques in action.

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

Database systems are the backbone of most modern information systems and a core technology without which today's economy - as well as many other aspects of our lifes - would be impossible in their present forms. The course teaches the architectural and algorithmic foundations of modern database management systems (DBMS), focussing on database systems internals rather than applications. Emphasis is made on robust and time-tested techniques that have led databases to be considered a mature technology and one of the greatest success stories in computer science. At the same time, opportunities for exciting research in this field will be pointed out.

In the exercise part of the course, important components of a DBMS will be treated and where possible implemented and their performance evaluated. The goal this is to work with the techniques introduced in the lecture and to understand them and their practical implications to a depth that would not be attainable by purely theoretical study.

## Inhalt

The course 'Database Systems' will introduce students to the internal workings of a DBMS, in particular:

- · storage media (disk, flash, main memory, caches, and any other future storage medium)
- · data managing architectures (DBMS, streams, file systems, clouds, appliances)
- · storage management (DB-file systems, raw devices, write-strategies, differential files, buffer management)
- · data layouts (horizontal and vertical partitioning, columns, hybrid mappings, compression, defragmentation)
- · indexing (one- and multidimensional, tree-structured, hash-, partition-based, bulk-loading and external sorting, differential indexing, read- and write-optimized indexing, data warehouse indexing, main-memory indexes, sparse and dense, direct and indirect, clustered and unclustered, main memory versus disk and/or flash-based)
- · processing models (operator model, pipeline models, push and pull, block-based iteration, vectorization, query compilation)
- · processing implementations (join algorithms for relational data, grouping and early aggregation, filtering)
- · query processing (scanning, plan computation, SIMD)
- · query optimization (query rewrite, cost models, cost-based optimization, join order, join graph, plan enumeration)
- · data recovery (single versus multiple instance, logging, ARIES)
- · parallelization of data and queries (horizontal and vertical partitioning, shared-nothing, replication, distributed query processing, NoSQL, MapReduce, Hadoop and/or similar and/or future systems)
- · read-optimized system concepts (search engines, data warehouses, OLAP)
- · write-optimized system concepts (OLTP, streaming data)
- · management of geographical data (GIS, google maps and similar tools)
- · main-memory techniques

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

The students should learn methods for the design, the implementation, and the validation of safety-critical embedded systems.

## Inhalt

Embedded Computer Systems are components of a technical system, e.g. an air plane, a car, a household machine, a production facility. They control some part of this system, often called the plant, e.g. the airbag controller in a car controls one or several airbags. Controlling means obtaining sensor values and computing values of actuator signals and sending them.

Most software taught in programming courses is transformational, i.e. it is started on some input, computes the corresponding output and terminates. Embedded software is reactive, i.e. it is continuously active waiting for signals from the plant and issuing signals to the plant.

Many embedded systems control safety-critical systems, i.e. malfunctioning of the system will in general cause severe damage. In addition, many have to satisfy real-time requirements, i.e. their reactions to input have to be produced within fixed deadlines.

Accordingtorecentstatistics, more than 99% of all processors are embedded. Processors in the ubiquitous PC are a negligible minority. Embedded systems have a great economical impact as most innovations in domains like avionics, automotive are connected to advances in computer control. On the other hand, failures in the design of such systems may have disastrous consequences for the functioning of the overall system. Therefore, formal specification techniques and automatic synthesis of software are used more than in other domains.

The course will cover most aspects of the design and implementation of embedded systems, e.g. specification mechanisms, embedded hardware, operating systems, scheduling, validation methods.

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

The students will gain a deep understanding of algorithms used in Automatic Planning for the efficient exploration of large state spaces, from both a theoretical and practical point of view. The programming exercises will familiarize them with the main implementation basis in Automatic Planning. The search algorithms are generic and are relevant also in other CS subareas in which large transition systems need to be analyzed.

## Inhalt

AutomaticPlanningisoneofthefundamentalsub-areasofArtificialIntelligence,concernedwithalgorithmsthatcangenerate strategies of action for arbitrary autonomous agents in arbitrary environments. The course examines the technical core of the current research on solving this kind of problem, consisting of paradigms for automatically generating heuristic functions (lower bound solution cost estimators), as well as optimality-preserving pruning methods. Apart from understanding these techniques themselves, the course explains how to analyze, combine, and compare them.

Starting from an implementation basis provided, students implement their own planning system as part of the course. The course is concluded by a competition between these student systems.

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

AVCN will deepen the students' knowledge on modern communications systems and will focus on wireless systems.

Since from a telecommunications perspective the combination of audio/visual data - meaning inherently high data rate and putting high requirements on the realtime capabilities of the underlying network - and wireless transmission - that is unreliable and highly dynamic with respect to the channel characteristics and its capacity - is the most demanding application domain.

## Inhalt

As the basic principle the course will study and introduce the building blocks of wireless communication systems. Multiple access schemes like TDMA, FDMA, CDMA and SDMA are introduced, antennas and propagation incl. link budget calculations are dealt with and more advanced channel models like MIMO are investigated. Modulation and error correction technologies presented in Telecommunications I will be expanded by e.g. turbo coding and receiver architectures like RAKE and BLAST will be introduced. A noticeable portion of the lecture will present existing and future wireless networks and their extensions for audio/visual data. Examples include 802.11n and the terrestrial DVB system (DVB-T2).

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

The students will gain a deep understanding of the automata-theoretic background of automated verification and program synthesis.

## Inhalt

The theory of automata over infinite objects provides a succinct, expressive and formal framework for reasoning about reactive systems, such as communication protocols and control systems. Reactive systems are characterized by their nonterminating behaviour and persistent interaction with their environment.

In this course we study the main ingredients of this elegant theory, and its application to automatic verification (model checking) and program synthesis.

- · Automata over infinite words and trees (omega-automata)
- · Infinite two-person games
- · Logical systems for the specification of nonterminating behavior
- · Transformation of automata according to logical operations

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

Correspondence problems are a central topic in computer vision. Thereby, one is interested in identifying and matching corresponding features in different images/views of the same scene. Typical corresondence problems are the estimation of motion information from consecutive frames of an image sequence (optic flow), the reconstruction of a 3-D scene from a stereo image pair and the registration of medical image data from different modalities (e.g. CT and MRT). Central part of this lecture is the discussion of the most important correspondence problems as well as the modelling of suitable algorithms for solving them.

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

Many modern techniques in image processing and computer vision make use of methods based on partial differential equations (PDEs) and variational calculus. Moreover, many classical methods may be reinterpreted as approximations of PDEbased techniques. In this course the students will get an in-depth insight into these methods. For each of these techniques, they will learn the basic ideas as well as theoretical and algorithmic aspects. Examples from the fields of medical imaging and computer aided quality control will illustrate the various application possibilities.

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

Many computer scientists will be confronted with morally difficult situations at some point in their career - be it in research, in business, or in industry. This module equips participants with the crucial assets enabling them to recognize such situations and to devise ways to arrive at a justified moral judgment regarding the question what one is permitted to do and what one should better not do. For that, participants will be made familiar with moral theories from philosophy, as well as different Codes of Ethics for computer scientists. Since one can quickly get lost when talking about ethics and morals, it is especially important to talk and argue clearly and precisely. In order to do prepare for that, the module offers substantial training regarding formal and informal argumentation skills enabling participants to argue beyond the level of everyday discussions at bars and parties. In the end, succesful participants are able to assess a morally controversial topic from computer science on their own and give a convincing argument for their respective assessments.

The module is intended to always be as clear, precise, and analytic as possible. What you won't find here is the meaningless bla-bla, needlessly poetic language, and vague and wordy profundity that some people tend to associate with philosophy.

## Inhalt

## This course covers:

- · an introduction to the methods of philosophy, argumentation theory, and the basics of normative as well as applied ethics;
- · relevant moral codices issued by professional associations like the ACM, the IEEE, and more;
- · starting points to evaluate practices and technologies already in use or not that far away, including for instance: filter bubbles and echo chambers, ML-algorithms as predictive tools, GPS-tracking, CCTV and other tools from surveillance, fitness trackers, big data analysis, autonomous vehicles, lethal autonomous weapons systems and so on;
- · an outlook on more futuristic topics like machine ethics, roboethics, and superintelligences;
- · and more.

The content of the course is updated regularly to always be up-to-date and cover the currently most relevant topics, technologies, policies, and developments.

The course introduces media transmission over packet channels, specifically the Internet. After establishing a Quality of Service framework built on ITU requirements the course models erasure channels without and with memory. Key characteristics like the channel capacity and the minimum redundancy information are derived.

The second part of the course introduces current media transport protocol suites (TCP, UDP, RTP, RTSP) and middleware (ISMA, DLNA, UPnP, DVB-IPI).

In the second half of the course audiovisual coders used in the Internet are introduced (H.264, AAC), state-of-the-art forwarderror coding schems (Van-der-Monde-Codes, Fountain Codes) are explained and essential elements like a Digital Phaselocked Loop are developed.

## Literaturhinweise

The course will come with a self contained manuscript. The most essential monographs used for and referenced within the manuscript are available in the Computer Science Library of Saarland University.

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

At the core of computer graphics is the requirement to render highly realistic and often even physically-accurate images of virtual 3D scenes. In this lecture students will learn about physically-based lighting simulation techniques to compute the distribution of light even in complex environment. The course also covers issues of perception of images, including also HDR technology, display technology, and related topics.

After this course students should be able to build their own highly realistic but also efficient rendering system.

## Lernziele / Kompetenzen

In the Bachelor's seminar, the student acquires the ability to work scientifically in the context of an appropriate subject area under supervision.

At the end of the Bachelor's seminar, the foundations for the successful completion of the Bachelor's thesis are laid and essential approaches to solving the problem are already determined.

The Bachelor's seminar thus prepares the topic and execution of the Bachelor's thesis.

It also teaches practical skills of scientific discourse. These skills are taught through active participation in a reading circle, in which the discussion of scientifically challenging topics is practised.

## Inhalt

Familiarisation with a scientific subject area within the field of computer science.

Preparation of a written elaboration of the task of the Bachelor thesis and the relevant scientific literature.

Presentation of the subject area and the planned task of the Bachelor's thesis.
