## Assessment Types

According to § 14 APSO-INGI, as currently applicable, the assessment types for the following module handbook are defined as follows:

## 1. Case study (Fallstudie / FS)

A case study is a piece of written work presenting a reasoned solution to a set problem. Students work either individually or in a group to establish, analyse and solve specific problems in practice by applying scientific  and academic methods and findings. Case studies are set for specific classes, and must be completed in the same semester as the class and by the time the class ends. The programme-specific examination and study regulations may contain more detailed provisions on the time available for case studies.

## 2. Home project (Hausarbeit / H)

A home project is a piece of written work, to be produced by the student on his or her own and outside class hours, in which the student is to prove that he or she is able to investigate and analyse a set question or subject independently. A maximum of three months is allowed for completion. If the home project constitutes  an  examination,  the  programme-specific  examination  and  study  regulations  may  specify whether or not a colloquium is to be held once the written project has been submitted. Colloquia should last between 15 and 45 minutes, and are generally to be held within one month of submission of the written work.

## 3. Written examination (Klausur / K)

A written examination is completed under supervision. Students must complete the set questions on their  own,  either  without  the  use  of  study  aids  or  with  the  use  of  specified  study  aids  only.  Written examinations last at least 60 and no longer than 240 minutes.

## 4. Colloquium (Kolloquium / KO)

A  colloquium  may  be  required  as  part  of  certain  types  of  examination,  or  in  combination  with  the Bachelor  or  Master  thesis.  A  colloquium  is  an  oral  examination  in  which  students  must  prove  their knowledge  of  the  material  examined,  speaking  and  responding  freely  in  an  open  discussion.  A colloquium lasts at least 15 and no more than 45 minutes, and is also aimed at establishing that the written work submitted was all the student's own work. Colloquia can be organised as individual or group examinations. The size of the group for group examinations should be considered accordingly when setting the length of the examination.

## 5. Construction task (Konstruktionsarbeit / KN)

A construction task is a piece of written work in which the student must prove his or her design skills by solving practical tasks. A maximum of three months is allowed for completion.

## 6. Lab work completion (Laborabschluss / LA)

Lab work is successfully completed when students have successfully conducted the experiments set by the  examiner  during  the  semester  and  have  demonstrated  their  knowledge  by  taking  part  in corresponding colloquia and/or by submitting written records of their work and/or by completing set written tasks. Colloquia last for a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 45 minutes. The written work must be submitted by a deadline set by the examiner; the latest deadline is the end of the semester in which the class in question was taken.

## 7. Lab work examination (Laborprüfung / LR)

Lab work examination consists of the completion of lab work and a final examination at the end of the class. In the examination, the student is required to conduct and solve an experiment on his or her own and independently. Examinations last at least 60 and no more than 240 minutes.

## 8. Oral examination (Mündliche Prüfung / M)

In an oral examination, a student must demonstrate in discussion with the examiner that he or she fully understands the material on which he or she is being examined. Oral examinations generally last at least 15  and  no  more  than  45  minutes.  Oral  examinations  may  be  conducted  as  individual  or  group

examinations, and are to be conducted by one examiner and one assessor in accordance with Section An oral examination may alternatively be conducted by two or more examiners instead of one, i.e. by a panel of examiners; in such a case, the student is to be examined by one examiner only in each of the various examination subjects. Oral examinations are always assessed and graded by one examiner only, no matter whether they are conducted by several examiners or by an examiner and an assessor. The examiner responsible  for  grading  in  each  case  must  consider  the  views  of  the  other  examiners/the assessor before deciding on the grade to be awarded. The main aspects covered in and results of each oral examination are to be recorded. The record is signed by the examiners and assessor and is filed with the examination documents.

## 9. Project (Projekt / Pj)

A project is an interdisciplinary task relating to the area of industry or business for which the course is designed. The results of projects must be documented. At least 6 and no more than 26 weeks are allowed for projects. Project work is generally completed with a colloquium. The applicable programme-specific examination and study regulations may specify additional requirements in terms of the form, content and goal of the project, and may specify another form of final assessment instead of a colloquium.

## 10. Paper (Referat / R)

A paper is a presentation lasting between 15 and 45 minutes on the basis of written preparation by the student. A paper is followed by a discussion led by the student or tutor. Papers should not be read out from detailed notes;  students  should  be  able  to  speak  spontaneously.  Digital  or  hard  copies  of  any presentations and graphics used are to be submitted to the examiner. The detailed written paper to be submitted to the examiner should summarise the key findings and conclusions.

## 11. Test (T)

Tests are pieces of written work in which students demonstrate their ability to solve set tasks in a clearly defined subject area under examination conditions. Tests last at least 15 and no more than 90 minutes. The  programme-specific  examination  and  study  regulations  may  specify  that  test  results  are  to  be included in the overall grade for written examinations.

## 12. Exercise slip (Übungstestat / ÜT)

An exercise slip is awarded once a student has successfully solved the written theory tasks set by the examiner and has demonstrated his or her knowledge of the subject in a colloquium or paper. Colloquia last at least 15 and no more than 45 minutes. The written work must be submitted by a deadline set by the examiner; the latest deadline is the end of the semester in which the class type in question (exercise) was taken.

## 13. Portfolio examination (Portfolio-Prüfung / PP)

A portfolio exam is a type of exam that consists of a maximum of ten exam items. At least two distinct types of examination should be used for the portfolio examination. The possible forms of examination that can be used result from the forms of examination mentioned in § 14 paragraph 3 APSO-INGI as well as from exercises during the semester. At the beginning of the course, the lecturer determines with which examination elements and with which weighting for the individual examination elements the portfolio examination is to take place. In the case of an examination performance, the individual examination

elements lead to an overall grade for the respective portfolio examination according to their weighting. The overall scope of the portfolio test based on workload and degree of difficulty must not exceed the scope of the type of test if this were selected as the only test element.

## 14. Take-home examination (Take-Home Prüfung / THP)

A take-home examination consists of the independent processing of one or more specified examination tasks, which is conducted by the student regardless of location with the help of approved aids within the specified processing time. The assignment of the examination tasks and the submission of the solutions are done in electronic form. The processing time is at least 60 and at most 300 minutes. The duration of the examination consists of the processing time and the time that is given to the students for the creation and downloading and uploading of the examination documents. The examination takes place via the software, collaboration, video conferencing systems or learning platforms provided by the university. Before the examination, the students should be given the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the software, collaboration, video conferencing systems or learning platforms. When submitting the work, the student assures in writing or in electronic form that they have written the work independently, within the specified processing time and using no other than the permitted aids specified.
