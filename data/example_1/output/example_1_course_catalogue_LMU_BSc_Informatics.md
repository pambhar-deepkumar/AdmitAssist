## About the Programme of Studies

The Bachelor programme in computer science plus statistics prepares students for the professional practice in the field of computer science in application, manufacturing, research and teachingrelated activities. The goal of the training is to develop the fundamentals of the subject in theoretical and practical aspects. The ability is to be developed to independently recognize and solve a variety of problems in information processing. Students acquire knowledge and methods in the central areas of computer science based on formal foundations. Moreover, with a wide variety of minor subjects, the programme is very application oriented. Upon completion of training the students should have knowledge about properties of information processing and the possibilities to describe them with formal methods. They should know about the structures and modes of action of information processing systems. In cooperation with the users they must be able to analyse complex tasks, formulated in the language of the application area, structure it, abstractly formulate, and present it in a way suitable to submit it to a mechanical solution. Of particular importance is the ability to adapt to changing application areas to adapt to the changing conditions of the practice of information processing, and to participate actively in the changes of the IT-world. The bachelor programme, among other things, lays the foundation for a research-oriented improvement of knowledge and skills in the master programme.

The core Computer Science part of the programme covers the main topics in this field, programming (Java and Haskell) together with Software Engineering, Theoretical Computer Science (formal languages, computability, complexity theory, logic, algorithms and data structures), Database Technology (relational databases, index structures, data mining), Computer Architecture, Operating System, Computer Networks and Mobile Systems, Web-technology. A significant part of the basic courses is a practical training where small teams of students have to implement a complex piece of software.

Most modules are compulsory. However, there are two so-called "special topics" modules. In the two with 6 credit points assessed modules, students can choose from a wide range of in-depth courses in Computer Science, Media Informatics and Bioinformatics. The concrete contents of the courses may vary from semester to semester. They are usually determined by the current research of teaching staff and thus serve the implementation of the principle of research orientation in teaching: By taking courses in the field of in-depth topics, students are introduced to current research questions and gain insight into the development of the research area. In order to promote excellent students, students in the Bachelor programme are already offered the possibility to visit courses that are especially designed for master students (- the descriptions of these modules contain information about the prerequisits for visiting them as a Bachelor student). The achievable level of competence includes the ability to collaborate with the Master students and thereby to be able to make the first valuable contributions.

In addition to the core curriculum in computer science students choose from an extensive list of modules from statistics. The overall level of education in mathematics and statistics corresponds to approximately the mathematical foundation in mathematics which all the computer science students get, plus additional training in the scope of a normal minor subject. Nine further credits have to be acquired from an offer of (more or less) soft skill modules, (ethics, legislation, personal and social competence, IT-competence, tutoring jobs etc.). The Bachelor thesis in the last semester earns 12 credits plus 3 credits for the final presentation. All in all the Bachelor programme lasts six semesters and requires the students to acquire 180 credit points. The final mark is obtained separately from the ECTS-weighted marks of the module. Modules with 30 credits in total where the student got the worst marks are ignored when computing the final grade.

## Teaching

Lang.

## Contents

This module provides an introduction to the imperative, object-oriented and concurrent programming using a high level language, e.g. Java. In addition to the knowledge of general programming principles, concepts, methods and techniques for displaying, structuring and processing of data and the development of algorithms are discussed. Particular emphasis is set on conceptual clarity and precise mathematical foundation with formal methods.

The main topics of the course are as follows:

- · basic concepts about programs and their implementation;
- · syntax of programming languages and their description;
- · basic data types and imperative control structures;
- · complexity and correctness of imperative programs;
- · recursion;
- · simple sorting methods;
- · introduction to the object-oriented program design;
- · classes, interfaces and packages;
- · inheritance, and exception handling;
- · object-oriented implementation of lists and tree structures;
- · basic concepts of concurrent programming: threads, synchronization and deadlock,
- · Introduction to UML-Diagrams,
- · Programming with an Integrated Development Environment (currently Eclipse).

## Recommended Literature

There is a multitude of introductory books about Computer Science and Java in particular. A comprehensive Java book, which is also online available, is:

- · Java ist auch eine Insel, von Christian Ullenboom, Gilileo Computing, ISBN = 978-3-83621802-3

An easier introductory book is

- · Java kompakt, von Hözl, Read und Wirsing, Springer Vieweg, ISBN 978-3-642-28503-5

The module consists of a lecture and in addition exercises in small groups. The concepts introduced in the lecture are practiced in the exercise class with concrete examples.

## Qualifikation Aims

The students will be able to implement solutions for small and manageable problems algorithmically and to realize them with a high level programming language as executable programs. Using an IDE like Eclipse facilitates the professionalisation. Furthermore, students develop an understanding of the general principles of programming and programming languages. This lays the foundation to ensure that the students (after further experiences in the course of study) may become familiar quickly and accurately with any programming language.

## Contents

This module provides an overview of the binary representation of information on computers and on the architecture and operation of modern von Neumann computers. The traditional components of a computer are introduced. Their interaction is first theoretically and then practically illustrated with a machine language and an assembly language. It is shown how to use the Boolean Algebra for designing simple circuits as well as more complex components of a processor and memory, and how to optimize them systematically.

## The main topics of the course are as follows:

- · the binary representation of information in the computer;
- · the realisation of computer memory by electronic circuits and by optical and magnetic media;
- · Boolean Algebra for the design of electronic circuits;
- · design and optimisation of simple logic circuits in processors;
- · components of the von Neumann architecture and its optimization;
- · a machine-level assembly language;
- · the interaction between the lower level components of a computer, as well as
- · parallelization and multi-processor systems.

The module starts with an introduction into elementary probability calculus and combinatorics. Then univariate and multivariate random variables, discrete and continuous distributions, and the most important limit theorems underlying statistical analysis are discussed. In the part concerned with inductive statistics basic problems of parameter estimation and hypotheses testing are introduced, and specific tests for independendt and dependent samples are discussed. Finally, inductive aspects of regression analysis are considered.

## Qualifikation Aims

The students know the fundamental theorems of probability theory and develop an understanding for statistical thinking underlying estimation and testing problems. Basic Problems in estimation, testing and regression analysis can be formalized and solved, the underlying assumptions can be reflected critically.

## Contents

The module provides classification, structure and function of networks with a focus on communication protocols and integrates basic components of distributed systems. For this it uses the popular layered models and architectures. Concepts and procedures independent of the layers are addressed separately, in order to specialise them by examples of communication protocols in all major layers of the model. These include the physical layer, the data link layer including multiple access, the network layer, the transport layer, and also the Internet Service Protocols. The presentation and the communication layers are introduced with concepts from the communication middleware for distributed systems. As an outlook for the operation of distributed systems, the module treats summarily the basics of Internet management.

The module consists of a lecture and in addition exercises in small groups. The concepts introduced in the lecture are practiced in the exercise class with concrete examples.

## Qualifikation Aims

The qualification aims are:

- · Understanding of the methods and techniques in computer networks and distributed systems;
- · Ability of classification and evaluation of new protocols;
- · Understanding of distributed applications and their relation to the properties of the underlying network.

## Contents

In this module the multiple linear regression model is introduced including model assumptions and principles of parameter estimation. Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance are treated as special cases of the model. Furthermore, extensions of the linear model, e.g. the logistic regression model and the general linear model are presented.

The module consists of a lecture and in addition exercises in small groups. The concepts introduced in the lecture are practiced in the exercise class with concrete examples.

## Qualifikation Aims

Estimation and testing for linear models, analysis of variance and covariance, limits and extensions of the linear model should be taught. The possible applications of the linear model as a basis for other lectures should be understood.

## Contents

This is the first of two so-called "abstract" modules in the Bachelor programme. In both with 6 ECTS credits rated modules, students can choose from a wide range of in-depth courses in Infomratics, Mediainformatics and Bioinformatics. The concrete contents of the courses can vary from semester to semester. They are usually inspired by the teaching staff's research and thus serve the principle of research orientation in teaching: By visiting in-depth modules, students will be introduced to current issues in research and gain insight into the development of the field. In order to promote excellent bachelor students they are already opened the possibility to visit master level modules (- appropriate characterization is done in the module descriptions, in particular whether it is necessary to have already provided excellent achievements in previous studies). The achievable level of competence is the proven ability to work together in dialogue with master level students and thereby to be able to bring in first valuable contributions.

## Qualifikation Aims

By visiting special topics modules, students acquire the basic ability to understand university research: The introduction to current research projects of teachers, in particular, makes the students aware of how to deal with scientific issues and enables them for developing first own ideas for advanced learning processes.

## Contents

This is the second of two so-called "abstract" modules in the Bachelor programme. In both with 6 ECTS credits rated modules, students can choose from a wide range of in-depth courses in Infomratics, Mediainformatics and Bioinformatics. The concrete contents of the courses can vary from semester to semester. They are usually inspired by the teaching staff's research and thus serve the principle of research orientation in teaching: By visiting in-depth modules, students will be introduced to current issues in research and gain insight into the development of the field. In order to promote excellent bachelor students they are already opened the possibility to visit master level modules (- appropriate characterization is done in the module descriptions, in particular whether it is necessary to have already provided excellent achievements in previous studies). The achievable level of competence is the proven ability to work together in dialogue with master level students and thereby to be able to bring in first valuable contributions.

## Qualifikation Aims

By visiting special topics modules, students acquire the basic ability to understand university research: The introduction to current research projects of teachers, in particular, makes the students aware of how to deal with scientific issues and enables them for developing first own ideas for advanced learning processes.

The seminar focuses on social authority and self authority. Social authorities are in particular communicative authority, authority for the technology of communication, authority to handling partners, authority for the conflict recognition and conflict management, authority for the dissolution of conflict situations, intercultural authority, social project management/team ability, authority for the controlling of the interior relations, authority for the support of the external relations. Self authorities are in particular reflection/criticism ability, flexibility, motivation, learning and readiness to perform, perseverance and reliability, ethics and responsibility.

## Qualifikation Aims

The students learn, to present their ideas and proposals convincingly in written and oral form, to recognise different positions and opinions of their partners and to integrate them in appropriate solutions, even if their partners are not familiar with the way computer scientists talk and think. In addition skills in conflict management are necessary to argue goal oriented in controversy discussions and to accept critics in a positive way. The ability to recognise and resolve misunderstandings early. Furthermore, the ability to recognise the impact of informatics on the social, economical, psychological, legal aspects as well as aspects pertaining to labour law of the society will be developed.

## Contents

The module consists of an introductory phase where the basic programming techniques that are needed for the later work, are introduced. In the second phase a complex software development project will be implemented in teams of three to six students. The main focus of the module is to get experience in team-oriented software development using generally available tools and methods.

The practical work is accompanied by a plenary session, in which the software development techniques necessary for the project are discussed. This typically includes programming with programming libraries, graphics programming, aspects of object-oriented analysis, introduction to client-server programming and the use of software management tools. In addition actual problems which showed up in the current phase of the project are discussed.

The students work independently in small teams. Each team is assigned an adviser who helps the team in the upcoming tasks.

## Qualifikation Aims

The software development internship provides practical experience in team-based development of a larger and complex software system using commonly available tools and methods. The goal is to develop the ability to develop in a small team a major software project. Upon successfully completing the software development internship, the participants should dare to take a student job in the IT industry.

## Remarks

For the successful completion of the practical course basic knowledge of the Java programming language is essential.

## Contents

This practical training in system development covers selected problems and challenges in the area of system programming. Basic knowledge in a programming language is no prerequisite. An accompanying lecture gives an overview about the necessary basics using C. In any case, it is reasonable to have basic knowledge in an imperative programming language such as e.g. C/C++, Pascal or Java and the use of text editors at hand.

## Qualifikation Aims

It is the goal to learn system programming using C. The topics and exercises cover for example interface specifications, modular software development, formatted I/O, parsers and parsing, CPU scheduling, processes and their management, inter-process communication and process synchronization, signaling, pipes, sockets, communication protocols, the TCP/IP protocol family as well as the client/server programming model.

## Contents

This module introduces sampling theory. First, the design of simple random sampling is presented. Then the basics of using auxiliary variables (model based techniques) are given. Then the Horwitz-Thompson theorem as a fundament for complex sampling designs is explained. Further issues of the lecture are complex designs, like stratified sampling, cluster sampling, two stage sampling and more phase sampling. Furthermore, an overview on possible reasons for bias in survey samples is given.

The module consists of a lecture and in addition exercises in small groups. The concepts introduced in the lecture are practiced in the exercise class with concrete examples.

## Qualifikation Aims

The students have a proficient knowledge of the fundamentals of survey sampling and the most important complex sampling designs and are able to design own sampling plans.

## 3 Special Topics

The subsequent list of modules are a selection of modules which can be acknowledged as Special Topics modules. These modules are serve the broardening and deepening of the knowledge and abilities. Several of them are based on the current focus in the research of the teaching staff and thus serve the consequent implementation of the principle of research orientation in teaching. By visiting these modules students are already introduced to current issues in research early on and gain insight into the further development of the subject. Modules from the Master Programmes can be recommended only for those students who have shown so far excellent results in their studies.

## Contents

This module provides an overview of the possible intellectual property rights. It also serves to highlight specific courses of action for the protection of developments in the field of computer science. In addition to non-technical property rights, such as trademark, design rights and copyright, a special focus will be given to technical rights like patent rights and utility model rights. Besides the question 'How can I protect my development from imitation?' the module also addresses the problem to enforce acquired protection rights.

## The main topics include:

- · Technical property rights (Patents, utility patents, property right strategies),
- · Computer implemented inventions (Copyright protection, license agreements, patent protection for computer implemented inventions),
- · Trademarks (trademark rights, trademarks, protection of trademarks, requirements for protection, infringement of trademarks),
- · Design patents, employee invention law,
- · Violation of intellectual property rights.

## Contents

Parallel computing encompasses the concurrent use of multiple cores to solve a given problem. Historically parallel computing has its roots in the area of scientific and high-performance computing (HPC), where today's Supercomputers are composed of a million computing cores and more. In recent years parallel computing has expanded its reach into almost all areas of the computing industry. Universally, servers, desktops, and notebooks are today equipped with multicore CPUs, a trend that is recently also expanding into the area of smartphones and tablets. In all cases the only way to make efficient use of the available hardware resources is the explicit parallel programming and parallel computing is thus increasingly becoming a "must have skill" for IT professionals.

The module consists of a lecture and in addition exercises in small groups. The concepts introduced in the lecture are practiced in the exercise class with concrete examples.

## Qualifikation Aims

The lecture is composed of three interwoven topical areas: parallel architectures, parallel algorithms and parallel programming. The successful participants will be able to identify independent parallel tasks in a variety of settings and create efficient realizations of algorithms on computing platforms that range from smartphones over accelerators to supercomputers such as SuperMUC at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre.

## Contents

The course takes places in cooperation with an industry partner and consists of two stages. The first stage is made up of three theoretical sessions during lecture period, which are used for presenting the ongoing topics to the students and for the formation of working groups. The participants then have the possibility to discuss the topics as well as to introduce their own ideas and proposals. Eventually, tasks will be assigned to the working groups in order to create conceptual designs for each topic.

In the second stage the participants will practically implement the developed concepts. Over the time of two weeks the students will work in groups on the system's implementation (if possible at the industry partner's site). The practical course concludes with a presentation of the results on behalf of the participants.

Typically, this course involves the following aspects:

- · mobile application development (e.g., for iOS or Android),
- · delevopment of corresponding databases and backend systems (usually Java-based),
- · realization of hardware-based functionalities using specialized platforms, such as RaspberryPi or Arduino boards.

Participants are working autonomously in teams of usually about four to six persons, while intensively being supported by staff from the Lehrstuhl and the industry partner.

## Prior Knowledge

Profound knowledge of object-oriented software development and distributed systems

## Qualifikation Aims

The practical course offers its participants the possibility to design and implement innovative solutions for current topics in cooperation with a partner from industry. Participants will gain practical experience concerning the realization of innovative IT projects. This provides challenges for the students on different levels: (unforeseeable) technical difficulties have to be overcome, working groups must organize themselves and act as a team even under pressure. Participants will learn to put their existing knowledge to good use as well as to quickly and autonomously acquire new knowledge.

Apart from challenges such as solving unknown problems and understanding new technologies, non-technical tasks such as project management, communication with real customers and presentation of results have to be accomplished.

- · Introduction to Android,
- · Outdoor positioning,
- · Indoor positioning,
- · Wireless communication technologies: WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC,
- · Context-sensitive systems,
- · Location Based Services,
- · Client-server architectures and communication, REST.

In the theortical part the basic concepts necessary for the practical implementation are introduced. In the practical part the participants then work independently in small teams to solve the programming tasks.

## Prior Knowledge

Basic knowledge of Java, as well as in the field of computer networks

## Qualifikation Aims

The practical course gives the participants an overview of different sub-regions in the research area of mobile and distributed systems and also offers an introduction to programming mobile applications for Android on Linux. In addition, the correct handling of Web standards and the use of software frameworks is learned. Prior knowledge of software development with Java are therefore certainly helpful.
