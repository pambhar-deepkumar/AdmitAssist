The traditional components of a computer are introduced. Their interaction is first theoretically and then practically illustrated with a machine language and an assembly language. It is shown how to use the Boolean Algebra for designing simple circuits as well as more complex components of a processor and memory, and how to optimize them systematically. The main topics include the binary representation of information in the computer; the realisation of computer memory by electronic circuits and by optical and magnetic media; Boolean Algebra for the design of electronic circuits; design and optimisation of simple logic circuits in processors; components of the von Neumann architecture and its optimization; a machine-level assembly language; the interaction between the lower level components of a computer, as well as parallelization and multi-processor systems.\",\n",

They are introduced into the relationship between high-level languages and the processing of individual commands on the machine level. In particular, they should develop a sense of the consequences the machine architecture has for the execution of programs, written in high level languages. Students learn to rapidly become acquainted with complex systems and interrelations.\"\n",
