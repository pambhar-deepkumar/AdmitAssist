      "This is the first of two so-called \"abstract\" modules in the Bachelor programme. In both with 6 ECTS credits rated modules, students can choose from a wide range of in-depth courses in Infomratics, Mediainformatics and Bioinformatics. The concrete contents of the courses can vary from semester to semester. They are usually inspired by the teaching staff's research and thus serve the principle of research orientation in teaching: By visiting in-depth modules, students will be introduced to current issues in research and gain insight into the development of the field. In order to promote excellent bachelor students they are already opened the possibility to visit master level modules (- appropriate characterization is done in the module descriptions, in particular whether it is necessary to have already provided excellent achievements in previous studies). The achievable level of competence is the proven ability to work together in dialogue with master level students and thereby to be able to bring in first valuable contributions.\n",

      "The module provides classification, structure and function of networks with a focus on communication protocols and integrates basic components of distributed systems. For this it uses the popular layered models and architectures. Concepts and procedures independent of the layers are addressed separately, in order to specialise them by examples of communication protocols in all major layers of the model. These include the physical layer, the data link layer including multiple access, the network layer, the transport layer, and also the Internet Service Protocols. The presentation and the communication layers are introduced with concepts from the communication middleware for distributed systems. As an outlook for the operation of distributed systems, the module treats summarily the basics of Internet management.\n",

      "The module provides classification, structure and function of networks with a focus on communication protocols and integrates basic components of distributed systems. For this it uses the popular layered models and architectures. Concepts and procedures independent of the layers are addressed separately, in order to specialise them by examples of communication protocols in all major layers of the model. These include the physical layer, the data link layer including multiple access, the network layer, the transport layer, and also the Internet Service Protocols. The presentation and the communication layers are introduced with concepts from the communication middleware for distributed systems.
