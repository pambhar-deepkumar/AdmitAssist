These include the physical layer, the data link layer including multiple access, the network layer, the transport layer, and also the Internet Service Protocols. The presentation and the communication layers are introduced with concepts from the communication middleware for distributed systems. As an outlook for the operation of distributed systems, the module treats summarily the basics of Internet management. The module consists of a lecture and in addition exercises in small groups.
